Databases rely on several interconnected components to function effectively. 
These components work together to store, manage, retrieve, and secure data while ensuring efficient performance and reliability.
Understanding these components is vital for database engineers to design and optimize robust systems.

1- Query Processor:
  Key subcomponents
  1- Query Parsor
  2- Query optimizer
  3- Execution Engine

2- Storage Engine
  Key responsiblilies:
  - Organize data into pages, blocks and files
  - Manages indexing for faster data retrival
  - Support various storage formats such as row based or column storage
  Popular Storage Engines
  -InnoDB: Used in MYSQL, support ACID properties
  -WiredTiger: Used in MangoDB for document based storage

3- Transaction Manager
  Starts, commits, or rollback transactions
  Monitors concurrency to avoid conflicts

4- Lock Manager
  Types of Locks
  Shared Locks: Allows multiple users to read a resource
  Exclusive Locks: Prevent others from accessing the resource until the operation is completed

5- Cache Manager
  How it works
  Temperary stores query results or indexed data
  Reduce disk I/O operations, enhancing performance

6- Recovery Manager
  Functions
  Maintain logs of all transactions
  Performs rollback or rollforward operations

Catalog
  Stores information about the database
